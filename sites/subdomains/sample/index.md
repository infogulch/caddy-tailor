Base is a very simple theme, with no CSS, no JavaScript, no layout. It's an ideal start to build you own theme if you planned to display your content through pages grouped by categories and subcategories.

Each directory in your content directory is a category. And subdirectories are subcategories. CaddyTailor build a ul/li tree from this tree to make a menu as you can see at the top of this page. Each category page displays a list of pages they contain, except the `index.md`, which is used for the category page itself.

The pages listed below are top level pages.
